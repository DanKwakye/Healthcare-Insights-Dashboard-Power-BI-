Key Trends
Overview:
This view emphasizes overall hospital performance by analyzing patient volume, day-type admissions, and length of stay (LOS) trends.

General Stats:
Metric	Value
Admitted Patients	55,500
Rooms/Bedspace	400
Avg Billing Amount	25,539.32
Doctors	40,341
Avg LOS (Days)	15.51
Average Age	51.54

Admission Trends:
Weekday vs Weekend:
Weekday Admissions: 40K (71.49%)
Weekend Admissions: 16K (28.51%)


Length of Stay (LOS):
Extended Stay (15+ days): 30K patients (53.18%)
Short Stay (1–3 days): 8K (9.91%)


Monthly Admission Patterns:
Peak Month: July (4,919 patients)
Lowest Month: February (4,255 patients)
Admissions are consistent across weekdays, with Friday and Saturday showing slightly higher volumes.

Monthly Billing Trend by Admission Type:
Billing fluctuates across the year, with noticeable peaks in June and October.
Elective admissions showed the highest variability in billing.


3. Treatment & Cost
Overview:
This section breaks down treatment costs by Length of Stay (LOS), Admission Type, Hospital, and Medical Condition, along with detailed drug usage analytics.

Billing by LOS Bucket & Admission Type:
LOS Bucket	Highest Contributor	Total Billing
Extended Stay	All Admission Types	~0.3B
Long Stay	Elective	~0.1B
Moderate/Short	Urgent	Low Impact

Top Hospitals by Total Billing:
Hospital	Dominant Type	Approx Billing
Houston Methodist	Elective	~200M
Johns Hopkins	Emergency	~190M
UCLA	Mixed	~100M

Drug Usage by Condition (Top 3 Conditions):
Condition	Top Drug	Total Prescriptions
Hypertension	Aspirin	13,875
Diabetes	Ibuprofen	13,775
Obesity	Lipitor	12,765
Asthma had the lowest prescription volume among all listed conditions (3,885).


Insights & Recommendations
Chronic Conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, and obesity dominate treatment cost and medication use.
Extended hospital stays are the largest drivers of revenue across all admission types.
Hospitals like Houston Methodist and Johns Hopkins are critical contributors to both patient volume and billing.
Significant year-over-year drops in patient counts and room usage suggest possible impacts from external factors (e.g., pandemics).
